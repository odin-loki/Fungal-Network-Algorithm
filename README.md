# Bio-Inspired Network Algorithm: From Fungi to Computation

This algorithm transforms how fungi search for food into a powerful computational tool. By studying how fungi create efficient networks without central control, we've developed a system that combines pattern recognition, resource optimization, and network evolution in a uniquely natural way.

## Novel Techniques

### Physical Pattern Recognition
Instead of traditional neural network approaches, this algorithm recognizes patterns by physically reorganizing its network structure. This enables:
- Direct pattern matching through network topology
- Resource-driven pattern adaptation
- Natural geometric progression of states
- Self-organizing optimization

### Network Evolution
The system evolves through distinct states following geometric sequences:
- Exploration → Connection → Optimization → Stabilization
- Each state emerges naturally from simple rules
- Network structure adapts to environmental patterns
- Resource feedback drives evolution

### Optimization Methods
